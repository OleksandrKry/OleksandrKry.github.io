    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[261][5] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".[q] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[263] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for "artificial neurons" in 1943,[264] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible.(sourse: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Wikipedia</a>)</p></p>
